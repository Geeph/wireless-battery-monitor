# Wireless Battery Monitor

## Summary

This project is a prototype for a wireless battery monitor. The initial
objective was to create a dashboard for use on electric bikes, golf carts, or
other battery operated vehicles. The app connects to a custom hardware project
over bluetooth. The app can then receive voltage and current from this device,
while getting the current speed over GPS.

Some of the initial prototypes were used to monitor batteries and charging
for solar panel displays. There may be other similar applications.

## Status

Current status: the prototype works, but is far from complete.
